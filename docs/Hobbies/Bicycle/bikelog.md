A bike ride from the school to the seaside, with my friend BroXXian. The total distance traveled is over 100 km.
I'm not a professional cyclist, so it took a lot of time. We started in the afternoon, arrived at the
destination just before sunset. Luckily, we could take some great photos of the scenery.
