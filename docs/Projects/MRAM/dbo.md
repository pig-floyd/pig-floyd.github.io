Jun. 2022 - Present, in ShanghaiTech University.

## Overview

* Quantified the optimal read bias voltage of MRAM cell, in reference with measured results.
* Designed a dynamic bias optimization circuit (DBO) that can track the optimal read bias voltage in background,
with respect to a wide range of process variation and thermal conditions.
* Simulated the proposed DBO with 1-Mb MRAM array, using 28-nm PDK and Verilog-A MRAM model.
