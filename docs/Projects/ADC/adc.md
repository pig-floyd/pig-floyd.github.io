Apr. 2022 - Present, in ShanghaiTech University.
## Overview
*  Built a SAR ADC model including sampling jitter, thermal noise, mismatch and incomplete settling.
* Proposed a gain-boosting dynamic comparator featuring a modified pre-amplifier with positive feedback and static
current cut-off circuit.
* Designed an asynchronous SAR logic maximizing CDAC settling time and has low circuit complexity.
* Implemented a 12-bit 100 MS/s SAR ADC utilizing the proposed comparator and SAR logic.
* Customized circuit layout with area and mismatch optimization.
* Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, set up testing system with dedicated PCB and FPGA control program.
