## About Me
<img align="right" width="200px" src="./img/cat.jpg"/>
I am pursuing the MSc. in EE in [ShanghaiTech University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShanghaiTech_University), under the direction of [Prof. Xufeng Kou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wLxdeaoAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW). While studying Electrical Engineering at ShanghaiTech University as an undergraduate, I found myself deeply interested in analog and mixed signal integrated circuits. During my fourth undergraduate year, I had tried implementing a cryogenic ADC that can operate down to 10 K, as well as several [cryogenic circuit tests](./Projects/CRYO/cryo.md). Currently, as a graduate student, I'm working on multiple projects including [a SAR ADC in 28-nm CMOS](./Projects/ADC/adc.md) and [a read bias optimization circuit](./Projects/MRAM/dbo.md) for MRAM. My research skills are significantly amplified by my hands-on experience in circuit test and evaluation, including twice IC tape out experience, the designing of PCB evaluation board, the dedicated testbench program and equipment setup. I find great joy in enhancing the performance of the circuits and dealing with the critical challenges. This interest motivates me to dedicate a considerable amount of time to reviewing scholarly articles and refining my hands-on abilities.

I judge myself as a dynamic, innovative and kind person. Born in [Wenzhou, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenzhou), I always dream about traveling all around the globe and meet people in different ethic groups. I'm a rock music enthusiast, fan of [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd) and learning to play electric guitar at present. Besides, I'm keen on scale models and cycling.
