While studying Electrical Engineering at ShanghaiTech University as an undergraduate, I found myself deeply interested in analog and mixed signal integrated circuits. During my fourth undergraduate year, I had tried implementing a cryogenic ADC that can operate down to 10 K, as well as several cryogenic circuit tests. Currently, as a graduate student, I'm working on multiple projects including a SAR ADC in 28-nm CMOS and a read bias optimization circuit for MRAM. </p> <p>I judge myself as a dynamic, innovative and kind person. Born in Wenzhou, China, I always dream about traveling all around the globe and meet people in different ethnic groups. I'm a rock music enthusiast, fan of Pink Floyd and learning to play electric guitar at present. Besides, I'm keen on scale models and cycling.</p> <p>For more information, please refer to my CV page.</p>"},{"location":"#links","title":"Links","text":"<p> Google Scholar Linkedin Github Bilibili Reddit</p>"},{"location":"CV/cv/","title":"Renhe Chen (\u9648\u4eba\u548c)","text":"<p>A pdf verison can be downloaded here</p>"},{"location":"CV/cv/#education","title":"Education","text":""},{"location":"CV/cv/#shanghaitech-university-master-of-eng-candidate-in-electrical-engineering","title":"ShanghaiTech University (Master of Eng. candidate in Electrical Engineering)","text":"<p>2021-2024 (Expected) </p> <ul> <li>Thesis supervisor: Prof. Xufeng Kou</li> <li>GPA: 3.77/4.0</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CV/cv/#shanghaitech-university-bachelor-of-eng-in-electrical-engineering","title":"ShanghaiTech University (Bachelor of Eng. in Electrical Engineering)","text":"<p>2017-2021</p> <ul> <li>GPA: 3.71/4.0</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CV/cv/#publications","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"CV/cv/#conference-publications","title":"Conference publications","text":"<ul> <li>R.Chen, A.

In the case of medium resolution SAR-only ADCs, the comparator is the primary source of noise, thereby limiting the dynamic performance. In terms of high-speed designs, additional power consumption is often required to achieve the noise and speed benchmarks, which make the comparator one of the most power-intensive components in the entire ADC. </p> <p>In this project, I proposed a SAR ADC features a gain-boosting dynamic comparator design and a low-delay SAR logic. The presented comparator incorporates a positive feedback in the pre-amplifier, which enables a high gain during the integration phase, thereby improving the energy efficiency. Meanwhile, to ensure a sufficient settling time for the internal CDAC, an asynchronous SAR logic with a low logic delay in the SAR logic loop is implemented. Accordingly, a prototype ADC is manufactured using the 28-nm CMOS technology, which achieves a power consumption of 860 \\(\\mu\\)W at 75 MHz sampling frequency. Moreover, the measured SNDR of the prototype at Nyquist frequency is 60.9 dB, which translates to a Walden figure of merit (FoMw) of 12.7 fJ/conversion-step.</p> <p>PLEASE CLICK THE IMAGES TO ENLARGE.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Projects/ADC/adc/#see-also","title":"See also","text":"<p>Publications related to this project:</p> <ul> <li>R.

This, along with process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations, results in narrow sensing margins which are inevitably vulnerable to thermal noise and circuit mismatch-induced offset, therefore causing read errors. As for read-disturbance-free MRAMs like SOT and VCMA, sensing margin can be enlarged by raising the readout voltage. However, the TMR ratio normally displays a negative correlation with the bias voltage, and it also changes under temperature and process variations. </p> <p>In this project, I proposed a dynamic bias optimization (DBO) circuit to enable the real-time tracking of the optimal read voltage across PVT variations within an MRAM array. It optimizes read performance by adjusting the read bias voltage dynamically for maximum sensing margin. Simulation results on a 28-nm 1Mb MRAM macro show that the tracking accuracy of the proposed DBO circuit remains above 90% even when the optimal sensing voltage varies up to 50%. Such dynamic tracking strategy further results in up to two orders of magnitude reduction in the bit error rate with respect to different variations, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing MRAM performance and reliability.</p> <p>PLEASE CLICK THE IMAGES TO ENLARGE.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Projects/MRAM/dbo/#see-also","title":"See also","text":"<p>Publications related to this project:</p> <ul> <li>R.
